// NULL Pointers
// It is always a good practice to assign a NULL value to a pointer variable in case
// you do not have an exact address to be assigned. This is done at the time of variable declaration. A pointer that is assigned NULL is called a null pointer.
//
// The NULL pointer is a constant with a value of zero defined in several standard libraries.
// Consider the following program −

#include <stdio.h>

int main () {

   int  *ptr = NULL;

   printf("The value of ptr is : %x\n", ptr  );

   return 0;
}

// output: The value of ptr is 0
